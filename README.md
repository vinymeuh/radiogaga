The RaspDAC from [Audiophonics](https://www.audiophonics.fr/fr/) is a network audio player build around a Raspberry Pi. There is many software solutions to bring it to life: [Volumeio](https://volumio.org/), [piCorePlayer](https://www.picoreplayer.org/), [RuneAudio](http://www.runeaudio.com/) and others.

**Radiogaga** is my own solution based on [Alpine Linux](https://alpinelinux.org/) and [radiogagad](https://github.com/vinymeuh/radiogagad).
